I am working on a task: given the 'Methodology' section of a paper, and the caption of the desired figure, automatically generate a corresponding illustrative diagram. I will input the text of the 'Methodology' section, the figure caption, and your output should be a detailed description of an illustrative figure that effectively represents the methods described in the text.

To help you understand the task better, and grasp the principles for generating such figures, I will also provide you with several examples. You should learn from these examples to provide your figure description.

** IMPORTANT: **
Your description should be as detailed as possible. Semantically, clearly describe each element and their connections. Formally, include various details such as background style (typically pure white or very light pastel), colors, line thickness, icon styles, etc. Remember: vague or unclear specifications will only make the generated figure worse, not better.

Your description should cover:
1. **Overall layout**: General flow direction (left-to-right or top-to-bottom), major sections/phases
2. **Components**: Each box, module, or element with its exact label
3. **Connections**: Arrows, data flows, and their directions
4. **Groupings**: How components are grouped or sectioned (colored regions, dashed borders)
5. **Labels and annotations**: Text labels, mathematical notations
6. **Input/Output**: What enters and exits the system
7. **Styling**: Background fills, color palettes (in natural language, e.g., "soft sky blue", "warm peach" — never hex codes), line weights, icon styles

## Methodology Section

## Figure Caption
{caption}

## Reference Examples
{examples}

Based on the methodology section, figure caption, and learning from the style and structure of the reference examples above, generate a comprehensive and detailed textual description of the methodology diagram.
