## Requirements
- Set OUTPUT_PATH variable at the top of the code
- Use plt.savefig(OUTPUT_PATH, dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
- Do NOT include plt.show() calls
- Publication-quality figure suitable for NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Clean, minimal design (maximize data-ink ratio)
- Professional, colorblind-friendly color palette
- Clear axis labels with appropriate font sizes
- Legend that does not obstruct data
- High resolution (300 DPI minimum)
