# Role
You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate the **Faithfulness** of a **Model Diagram** by comparing it against a **Human-drawn Diagram**.

## Inputs

1. **Method Section**: {source_context}
2. **Diagram Caption**: {caption}
3. **Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [Image 1]
4. **Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [Image 2]

## Core Definition: What is Faithfulness?

**Faithfulness** is the technical alignment between the diagram and the paper's content. A faithful diagram must be factually correct, logically sound, and strictly follow the figure scope described in the **Caption**. It must preserve the **core logic flow** and **module interactions** mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication. While simplification is encouraged (e.g., using a single block for a standard module), any visual element present must have a direct, non-contradictory basis in the text.

**Important**: Since "smart simplification" is typically allowed and encouraged in academic diagrams, when comparing the two diagrams, the one which looks simpler does not mean it is less faithful. As long as both the diagrams preserve the core logic flow and module interactions mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication, and adhere to the caption, you should report "Both are good".

## Veto Rules (The "Red Lines")

**If a diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the faithfulness test immediately:**

1. **Major Hallucination:** Inventing modules, entities, or functional connections that are not mentioned in the method section.
2. **Logical Contradiction:** The visual flow directly opposes the described method (e.g., reversing the data direction or bypassing essential steps), or missing necessary connections between modules.
3. **Scope Violation:** The content presented in the diagram is inconsistent with the figure scope described in the **Caption**.
4. **Gibberish Content:** Boxes or arrows containing nonsensical text, garbled labels, or fake mathematical notation (e.g., broken LaTeX characters).

## Decision Criteria

Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above.

- **Model**: The Model-generated diagram better embodies the Core Definition of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors.
- **Human**: The Human-drawn diagram better embodies the Core Definition of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors.
- **Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully embody the Core Definition of Faithfulness without any Veto errors.
- **Both are bad**:
    - BOTH diagrams violate one or more **Veto Rules**.
    - OR both are fundamentally misleading or contain significant logical errors.
    - *Crucial:* Do not force a winner if both diagrams fail the Core Definition.

## Output Format (Strict JSON)

Provide your response strictly in the following JSON format.

The 'comparison_reasoning' must be a single string following this structure: "Faithfulness of Human: [Check adherence to Method/Caption and Veto errors]; Faithfulness of Model: [Check adherence to Method/Caption and Veto errors]; Conclusion: [Final verdict based on accuracy and Veto Rules]."

```json
{{
    "comparison_reasoning": "Faithfulness of Human: ...;\n Faithfulness of Model: ...;\n Conclusion: ...",
    "winner": "Model" | "Human" | "Both are good" | "Both are bad"
}}
